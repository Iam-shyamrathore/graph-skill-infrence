\title{Graph-Theoretic Skill Inference for Developer Profiling: \\ A Theoretical Framework}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a novel framework for developer profiling using Graph-Theoretic Skill Inference. By modeling developer activity as a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLM-based policies for optimal graph exploration. We further integrate Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) to provide rigorous confidence bounds on inferred skills, addressing epistemic uncertainty in skill discovery.
