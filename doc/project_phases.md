# Project Phases & Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan to build the Graph-Theoretic Skill Inference System.

## Phase 1: Extensive Research
**Goal:** Establish the theoretical foundation.
- **Output:** Research documents in `doc/research/`.
- **Activities:**
    - rigorous definition of the heterogeneous graph structure.
    - Mathematical formulation of edge weights and confidence scores.
    - Literature review search for related graph-based inference methods.

## Phase 2: Production-Level Architecture
**Goal:** Design a robust, scalable system.
- **Output:** Architecture docs in `doc/architecture/`.
- **Activities:**
    - Modular design (Graph Builder, Explorer, Calculator).
    - Data flow diagrams.
    - Class hierarchy and API definitions.

## Phase 3: Implementation
**Goal:** Build the working prototype.
- **Output:** Source code in `src/`.
- **Activities:**
    - Coding the components defined in Phase 2.
    - Unit testing.

## Phase 4: Experiments & Validation
**Goal:** Prove the theorems and system efficacy.
- **Output:** Data and analysis in `doc/experiments/`.
- **Activities:**
    - Running case studies.
    - Plotting convergence graphs.

## Phase 5: Paper Writing
**Goal:** Produce the final research paper.
- **Output:** Final paper in `doc/paper/`.
- **Activities:**
    - Synthesizing research, architecture, and results into IEEE format.
